# Machine Learning

## 1. Getting Started in Machine Learning

### 1.1 General

- Kaggle Learn: [kaggle.com/learn/](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/)
- [Machine Learning University](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC12LqyqTQYbXatYS9AA7Nuw/videos) | [by Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/machine-learning-course-free-online-from-amazon-machine-learning-university)

### 1.2 Learn Tensorflow

- **Learn in 3 hours**: go to the [start page](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd)
  and follow along with this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2nnJ4g6N0) (just the first part which is less than 2 hrs, skipping the part on reinforcement learning) and the accompanying
  [accompanying codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist/). This alone will be good enough to do basic image recognition in Tensorflow.
- **Learn in 15 hours**: follow Google's [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro). Use this to fill in on any concept that's only briefly covered in the 3-hr version.

### 1.3 Learn PyTorch

- **Learn in 1 hour**: start with the [Deep Learning with PyTorch: a 60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
