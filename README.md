## [Python Snippets](https://nathanielng.github.io/python-snippets/)

This is repository serves as a quick-reference of Python code snippets that are likely to
be frequently-used.  While it is likely that many equivalent snippets would be easily found
on Google, Stack Overflow, or a Python library documentation, these snippets are written in
a preferred coding style and some of them may be designed to work together. Also, a number
of them have (or eventually will have) unit tests, which typically are not available in many
code snippets on the internet.
