# Python Snippets

This is repository serves as a quick-reference of frequently-used snippets,
written in Python. The purpose of the repository is to avoid having to
find equivalent snippets on Google or Stack Overflow, and also to have
snippets written in a preferred coding style. A number of them will
also have unit tests, something that usually won't be available in many
code snippets on the web.


## Current Scope

- Python 3
- APIs
